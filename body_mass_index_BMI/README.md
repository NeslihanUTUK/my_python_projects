# BMI Calculator

This Python script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. It then classifies the BMI into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Features
- Input height in meters (e.g., 1.75).
- Input weight in kilograms (e.g., 70).
- Calculates BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight / (height ** 2)


- Provides a classification based on the calculated BMI:
- **Underweight**: BMI < 25
- **Normal weight**: 25 <= BMI < 30
- **Overweight**: 30 <= BMI <= 40
- **Obese**: BMI > 40

## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your height in meters when prompted.
3. Enter your weight in kilograms when prompted.
4. View your BMI value and classification.
